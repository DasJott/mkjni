Thank you
=========

When I was a bloody beginner and a total noob to vala there were people, who patiently helped me.
No question was too dumb for them to answer. I promised I would thank you and I do:

Pascal Garber
Igor Azevedo
Canek Pel√°ez
Yannick Inizan
Maciej Piechotka

And the nice vala community on Google+
