When I was a bloody beginner and a total noob to vala there were people, who patiently helped me.<br/>
No question was too dumb for them to answer.<br/>
<br/>
*I promised I would thank you and I do:*<br/>

Pascal Garber<br/>
Igor Azevedo<br/>
Canek Pel√°ez<br/>
Yannick Inizan<br/>
Maciej Piechotka<br/>
